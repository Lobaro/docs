# Disposal of Lobaro Devices

*Deutsche Version: [Entsorgung von Geräten von Lobaro](weee-entsorgung.md).*

This page informs you on our policy in respect to EU 
"Waste electrical and electronic equipment Directive" 2002/96/EC, 
implemented in German law by the 
"Gesetz über das Inverkehrbringen, die Rücknahme und 
	die umweltverträgliche Entsorgung von Elektro- und Elektronikgeräten 
	(Elektro- und Elektronikgerätegesetz &ndash; ElektroG)"
The following statements about the disposal of retired Lobaro devices are binding for customers
in Germany. Customers in other countries should contact there local authorities in order to 
acquire equivalent information for their respective country.

It is a major goal of EU directive 2002/96/EC reduce the amount of retired electronic devices disposed 
in household waste, but have them gathered in special facilities instead for recycling and orderly disposal.
Electronic devices often contain hazardous substances which are harmful to the environment as well as 
to human health. Under no circumstances should they be disposed in household trash.

## WEEE

The WEEE-directive is the EU-directive "Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment" (2002/96/EC).
It aims to reduce the growing amount of electrical and electronic waste created by disposed electronic 
devices. The goal is to avoid and reduce disposal, and to make the disposal more friendly for the environment, 
by including the manufacturer in a broader responsibility.

## Proper disposal of Lobaro B2B devices
Lobaro develops and manufactures devices for professional use. Because of this, our products have been 
recognised by the responsible agency "Stiftung EAR" (Elektro-Altgeräte Register) as
B2B (business to business) products. Lobaro GmbH is registered under DE18824018.

Classification as B2B implies that Lobaro is not required to pick up disposed electronic devices from 
local recycling points, as the law "ElektroG" dictates manufacturers of consumer electronics to do.

Consequently, our products may not be disposed in this way.

Instead, we offer our customers to take back retired Lobaro devices and dispose them properly free of charge.
Devices to be disposed must be sent to Lobaro GmbH postpaid and marked with the words 
"ZUR&nbsp;ENTSORGUNG".

## RoHS
As a manufacturer of industrial devices of information and telecommunication technology we are producing 
conforming to RoHS as specified in the EU-directive 2011/65/EU.

## Batteries
Conforming to the German law about the disposal of used batteries 
(§ 12 Satz 1 Nr. 1-3 BattV (Verordnung über die Rücknahme und Entsorgung gebrauchter 
Batterien und Akkumulatoren (BattVO) vom 27. März 1998 (BGBl. I S. 658))),
we as the manufacturer advise you, that the customer and end-consumer is required by law to return used 
batteries for a proper disposal. After usage, batteries can be returned to the vendor or at a place close 
proximity free of charge. If used batteries are sent to the vendor, parcels must be sent fully postpaid.
