Our devices are shipped ready to use with firmware installed on them, so normally you do not need to install firmware 
yourself. However, over time we sometimes add new features to our devices or fix bugs that come up over time.
If you want to use those improvements for devices all ready shipped to you, you can update the firmware yourself.

!!! info "Firmware updates with our config adapter vs. firmware update over the air (FUOTA)"
    This page describes how you install firmware on devices that you have physical access to. This can be done 
    for most of our devices, those using LoRaWAN and those using NB-IoT/LTE-M.
    
    Our NB-IoT/LTE-M devices also support installing firmware over the air, without physical access. This can 
    currently only be done by Lobaro.

## Connecting to your device
To connect your computer to your Lobaro device, your need a [Lobaro Config Adapter](/tools/usb-config-adapter.html) 
and the [Lobaro Maintenance Tool](/tools/lobaro-tool.html).
