# Versions of the Modbus LoRaWAN Bridge

Our devices are developed further and improved continuously. This sometimes breaks 
backwards compatibility or leads to huge changes in the documentation. On order to 
provide documentation for existing older devices we provide the manuals for older 
versions. 

If you are looking for the manual for an older revision, choose the manual with the
highest version number lower than the version number of your installed firmware. 
You can find out what firmware is installed on your hardware with our configuration 
adapter and configuration tool. The firmware version is printed in the log on device 
startup.

For an overview over the changes between manual releases, please refer to the 
[changelog](firmware.md#changelog).
