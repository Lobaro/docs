![Product Image](files/gpslorawan.png){: style="height:400px;display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

## Target Measurement / Purpose

The LoRaWAN GPS Tracker (GPS-LoRaWAN) is a battery powered tracking device, that
uses the satellite based positioning service GPS to determine its location and transmits the
obtained coordinates via LoRaWAN radio technology. Intervals between measurements can
be freely configured, in order to adjust the device to individual needs.
An integrated motion sensor detects changes in the device's movement (if it is picked up or
transported in a vehicle). This allows the device to switch between an `Active Mode` in which
frequent updates are uploaded during phases of movement and an `Alive Mode` that saves
battery power by sending only few updates. While not sending updates, the device enters a
sleep mode that only uses âˆ¼30 ÂµA.
Figure 1 shows the GPS Tracker with opened casing. The most important components are
indicated and explained.
Please read the manual carefully before operating the device. A safe operation of the
device is only possible if you follow the guides provided in this manual. Using the device
dierently than intended by Lobaro my cause damage to people, the environment, or
the device.

The GPS Tracker has a work cycle that adapts to detected motion of the device.

## Intial Phase

This is the phase that is executed after the device is started of restarted. The LED flashes
once and the configuration is evaluated. If successful, the LoRaWAN Join phase is executed
next.

## LoRaWAN Join Phase

If the Device is configured to use over the air activation (OTAA), the OTAA Join is performed
at this point. The device will repeatedly try to join its LoRaWAN network until the process
is successful. It then enters the Data Collection Phase.
If the Device is configured to use ABP instead of OTAA, this phase is left immediately and
the Data Collection Phase is entered.

## GPS Collection Phase

During the GPS Collection Phase the device will try to determine its coordinates (latitude,
longitude, and height) using GPS. You can identify this phase by the onboard LED flashing
on and off in one second intervals.
Once the position has been determined successfully (or the attempt timed out and failed,
because of bad GPS reception), the device enters the Data Transfer Phase.

## Data Transfer Phase

During the Data Transfer Phase the Tracker uploads the GPS coordinates to the LoRaWAN
network. The message contains the information if the measurement was successful. Some
status information about the device are included as well.
For a detailed description of the data sent refer to chapter 5.
After data transfer, the GPS Tracker enters a sleep state to save power. Depending on
how much time passed since the last physical movement of the device (determined by the
internal motion sensor), the Tracker enters diferent sleep phases. If the time since the last
detected motion is less than a timeout value (configurable, standard value is 65 minutes),
the device remains in `Active mode` enters only a short sleep phase (`Active Sleep`). If no
motion was detected for a time longer than the timeout, the device enters the `Alive Sleep`
Phase, which typically has a much longer sleeping time, but in which the device will also be
activated through movement.

## Active Sleep Phase

Even in Active Mode, the device spends most of its time in a deep sleep state to conserve
energy. The frequency with which the Tracker wakes up in Active Mode can be configured
using a Cron expression (see chapter 4.4). Typical values for active sleep time are 5 or 15
minutes.
When in Active Sleep Phase, the device will not be triggered to gather more GPS positions
through motion, but movement of the device will still be registered to keep the Tracker in
Active Mode.

## Alive Sleep Phase
When no movement has been detected for a long amount of time (configurable), the device
stops sending updates, since there is not much point in sending frequent position information
when the device does not change its position. In Alive Mode, only very few updates are sent
to keep the network informed about the device's health. Typically one message is sent per
day in this mode (frequency can be configured with a cron expression, see chapter 4.4).
When physical movement is detected by the internal motion sensor during this phase, the
GPS Tracker immediately wakes up and switches to Active Mode.

## Configuration, The Lobaro Maintenance Tool

![Modbus LoRaWAN Bridge](files/maintenancetool.png){: style="width:60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

The initial device configuration can be done very comfortably from your PC via the serial
configuration interface. Beside the needed Lobaro USB to UART adapter the Lobaro Main-
tenance Tool 1 needs to be installed. This tool is freely available for various operating systems
including Windows, Linux, Mac and Linux-ARM (e.g. Raspberry-PI) on and works with all
Lobaro sensors.
Technically this software opens a webserver on port 8585 that runs in a background console
window. The actual user interface can be accessed normally using a standard web browser
at address http://localhost:8585. Normally your default browser should be
opened with this URL automatically after tool startup . Even remote configuration and logobservation
over the Internet is possible, e.g. having a Raspberry PI via USB connected to
the Lobaro device and accessing the maintenance tool from a remote machines browser over
the Internet.
Additionally to the device setup the tool can also be used for firmware updates ('Firmware
Tab') , watching real-time device diagnostic output ('Logs Tab') and initiating device restarts.


!!! info "Info"
    Please note that the device is automatically restarted each time the configuration has been changed!

## Connecting the USB config adapter
For configuration and Firmware updates we provide a special serial-USB adapter that can be
connected as shown in Figure 4. The corresponding connector on the PCB is marked with
the word 'Config'.
The USB-adapter will add a virtual serial 'COM' Port to your system. Your operating system
needs the CP210x USB to UART Bridge2 driver installed. A download link is provided next
to the 'Connect' button when you start the Maintenance Tool.
While the config adapter is connected, the device will be powered from the USB port with
a regulated voltage of 3.3V. It is not necessary - although it would be no problem - having
batteries inserted or a different supply connected while using the config adapter. All
configuration parameters will be kept non-volatile regardless of the power supply.

![Modbus LoRaWAN Bridge](files/config.png){: style="width:50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;"}

## System Parameters
After being successfully connected to the hardware using the Lobaro Maintenance Tool you
can press 'Reload Config' in the 'Configuration' tab to read the current configuration from the
device. For every parameter a default value is stored non volatile inside the hardware to which
you can revert using the 'Restore default' button in case anything got miss configured.
All LoRaWAN & other firmware parameters are explained in the following.

## LoRaWAN network parameters
A large part of the configuration parameters are used to control the device's usage of Lo-
RaWAN. Table 1 lists all of them. There are two different ways to use LoRaWAN: over-the-air
activation (OTAA) and activation by personalization (ABP). Some configuration parameters
are only used with one of those methods, others are used for both.

|      Name  |     Type  |     Used     | Description|
|------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
|        OTAA|    bool   |      both    | true: use over-the-air activation (OTAA) <br> false: use activation by personalization (ABP)|
|         DevEUI|    bytes[8]       |   OTAA           |the 8 byte long DevEUI is used with OTAA to identify the device on join. The default is predefined in the hardware and guarantees an ID that is unique world wide. Should not be changed unless required by the network provider. Hex format without 0x prefix.           |
|    AppEUI        |      bytes[8]     |     OTAA         |   ID defining the application used in the LoRaWAN network. Hex format without 0x prefix.         |
|         AppKey   |   bytes[16]        |     OTAA          |     Application Key as defined by the LoRaWAN network operator. This is used to encrypt communication, so keep it secret. Hex format without 0x prefix.      |
|     OTAADelay       |      int     |      OTAA        |      Seconds to wait for a new attempt after an unsuccessful OTAA join. The actual waiting time will be randomly increased by up to a third of that amount, in order to avoid devices repeatedly interfering with each other through bad timing. The default value is 300, which means the timeout between attempts is 300-400 seconds.      |
|   AppSKey         |    bytes[16]       |    ABP          |     App Session Key as defined by the LoRaWAN network operator. Hex format without 0x prefix.       |
|       NetSKey     |     bytes[16]      |        ABP      |     Network Session Key ad defined by the LoRaWAN network operator. Hex format without 0x prefix.       |
|        DevAdr    |      bytes[4]     |    ABP          |    Device Address as defined by the LoRaWAN network operator. Hex format without 0x prefix.        |
|       SF     |        int   |     both         |  Initial LoRa spreading factor used for transmissions. Valid range is 7-12. The actual spreading factor used might change during operation of the device if Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) is used.          |
|          TxPower  |      int     |      both        |        Initial transmission output power in dBm. The Lo-RaWAN protocol allows only specific values: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14. The actual power used might change during operation if Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) is used.    |
|        ADR    |      bool     |         both     |       true: use adaptive data rate (ADR) <br> false: don't use adaptive data rate (ADR)     |

##GPS configuration parameters
The behaviour of the GPS Tracker and how it switches between its two operation modes
('Active' and 'Alive') can be adjusted to your needs. Table 2 explains the configuration
parameters used for this.

|      Name  |     Type  | Description|
|------------|-----------|------------|
|      ActiveCron      |   string        |     Cron expression defining how often the device will take a measurement and send its position over LoRaWAN while the Tracker is in Active Mode. This expression should trigger much more frequent than the one for Alive Mode. The standard is 0 0/15 * * * *, which will trigger every 15 minutes. See chapter "Cron expressions" for an introduction to cron expressions.       |
|        AliveCron    |   string        | Cron expression defining how often the device will wake up when in Alive Mode. This should be less frequent than in Active Mode. The standard is 0 0 0/12 * * *, which translates to twice each day. See chapter "Cron expressions" for an introduction to cron expressions.           |
|      gpsTO      |      int     |  Time in seconds to wait for GPS to get a fix before timing out. The standard value is 180 seconds.          |
|      actTO      |      int     |      Time in minutes without movement after which the Tracker switches to Alive Mode. The standard value is 65 minutes.      |
|        memsTh    |       int    |  Threshold for the internal motion detector to register movement. Values range from 2 to 255. A higher value makes the device less sensitive.<br>2 Environment (wind or steps) may trigger.<br>5 Standard, picking up the device will activate it. <br> 20 Carefully picking it up will not trigger the device.<br>50 When carried, running will trigger, walking won't.<br>100+ Shaking will activate, dropping the device might not.          |
|      CayenneLPP      |   bool        |      Use alternative Cayenne LPP upload format. Standard: false, e.g. use Lobaro Format. See chapter "myDevices Cayenne format" for an introduction to this format.      |

##Cron expressions
Cron expressions are used to define specific points in time and regular repetitions of them.
The schedule for data collecting phases is defined using the Cron format which is very
powerful format to define repeatedly occurring events.
Standard Lobaro devices typically do not need to know the real time for proper operation.
All times are relative to the random time when batteries are inserted. If needed
by the target application Lobaro can deliver on request special hardware support for keeping
data acquisition intervals based on a real time clock which stays in sync with the real time.
Please contact Lobaro directly if you need such a custom product variant.

A cron expression consists of 6 values separated by spaces:

* Seconds (0-59)
* Minutes (0-59)
* Hours (0-23)
* Days (1-31)
* Month (1-12)
* Day of Week (SUN-SAT b= [0,6])

Examples of CRON definitions: <br>

|       ||
|------------|-----------|
|0 5 ****    |hourly at minute 5, second 0 (at 00:05:00, 01:05:00, ...)|
|0 1/10 * * * *  |every 10 minutes from minute 1, second 0 (minutes 1, 11, 21, ...)|
|0 0 6 * * *     |daily at 6:00:00|
|0 0 13 1,15 * * |1st and 15th day of every month at 13:00:00|
|0 0 9 1-5 * *   |every month daily from day 1 till 5 at 9:00:00|

##LoRaWAN Data Upload Formats
After reading GPS coordinates (either successfully or unsuccessfully), the Tracker uploads the
data using LoRaWAN. As LoRaWAN can only transmit very short messages, the message
formats contain only data bytes, no keys or data types are included. The meaning of a byte
is determined by its position within a message. The tracker supports two dierent upload
formats as described in the following:

##Lobaro upload format (since Firmware Version 5)
Only a single massage format is used by the GPS Tracker, it has a fixed length of 17 bytes.
Figure 5 and table 3 explain the message format used.
This format uses the decimal degrees notation for the location, e.g. 53.4724Â° north and
9.9334Â° east. Positive (+) values indicate north longitudes and east latitudes, negative (-)
values indicate south longitudes and west latitudes. Both location values are transmitted as
signed integers in *big endian* format and get multiplied by 100.000. So after receiving the
location data must be divided by this factor.
Multi byte integers are transmitted as big endian. Values that would require decimal places
are transmitted in smaller units, e.g. 1/100000 degree (as described before), to handle only with
integers.

##Status flag

|bit|function|not set|set|
|-|-|-|-|
|1|Validity of last measurement|invalid|valid|
|2|Current operation mode|alive|active|
|3-8|reserved for future use|||

If during some configurable period of time (see "gpsTO" parameter in table "GPS configuration parameters") no GPS
location can be found the last known valid GPS location will be transmitted but with the
valid flag set to false.
We provide a JavaScript reference implementation of a decoder for the data packages as easy
to use download, which can be used directly for decoding in The Things Network.

##myDevices Cayenne format
As an alternative for the Lobaro data format the tracker can be configured to send Cayenne
LPP compatible LoRaWAN uploads. myDevices Cayenne8 allows you to quickly visualize the
via LoRaWAN transmitted data of the Lobaro GPS-tracker. You can use Cayenne as a tool
to visualize real-time and historical data, sent over The Things Network and various other
LoRaWAN providers.
To use the alternative upload format configuration parameter "CayenneLPP" must be set to
"true" as described in section "GPS configuration parameters" The advantages of using the cayenne format is a quick
device evaluation without programming some custom backend and/or front software. Disadvantages
are bigger LoRaWAN message sizes due to the additional schema meta information
overhead the format needs.

The Lobaro GPS Trackers maps its data to cayenne channels as follows:

|description|cayenne channel|cayenne type|
|-|-|-|
|Internal Temperature|0|Temperature|
|Battery Voltage|1|AnalogOutput|
|GPS data|2|GPS|
|satellites found|3|Digital Output|

##Legacy Lobaro upload format (up to Firmware Version 4)
This format is not supported any more since firmware version V5.0.0! Please consider updating
your device firmware using the Lobaro maintenance tool.
Only a single massage format is used by the GPS Tracker, it has a fixed length of 15 bytes.
This format uses the degrees with decimal minutes notation for the location.
Multi byte integers are transmitted as big endian. Values that would require decimal places
are transmitted in smaller units (e.g. mV instead of V).
The table underneath explains the message format used. We provide a JavaScript reference
implementation of a decoder for the data packages as easy to use download, which can be
used directly for decoding in The Things Network.
