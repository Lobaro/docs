Typical applications include reading out electric and water meters or retrieving data from environmental sensors like temperature and humidity. Configuration LoRaWAN UART Payload formats The Modbus Bridge sends different kinds of messages over different LoRaWAN ports: Port 1: Status messages Port 11: Data from reading Coils.. Port 12: Data from reading Discrete Inputs. Port 13: Data from reading Holding Registers. Port 14: Data from reading Input Registers. Status messages The Modbus Bridge sends a status messages report on the health of the device itself. This messages are sent along when the device is sending data packages with a maximum of one status message per day. Status messages are transmitted on port 1 and have a fixed length of 14 bytes. name pos len type description example version 0 3 uint8[3] Version of firmware running on the device [1, 0, 4] \u2261 v1.0.4 flag 3 1 uint8 Status flag, for internal use 0 temperature 4 2 int16 Device's internal temperature in tenth \u00b0C 246 \u2261 24.6\u00b0C voltage 6 2 int16 Voltage supplied by power source in mV 3547 \u2261 3.547V timestamp 8 5 int40 Internal date/time at creation of the status packet as UNIX timestamp 1533055905 mode 13 1 uint8 Operation mode the device runs 1 Data messages","title":"Modbus LoRaWAN Bridge"},{"location":"iot-devices/modbus-lorawan/#modbus-lorawan-bridge","text":"The Lobaro Modbus LoRaWAN Bridge is a low power device that can be used to read values out of a variety of other devices via Modbus (ASCII/RTU) over a RS-485 interface and forward them over LoRaWAN, so that they can be accessed from an attached system.
